# Lab 3: Complete a Web API â€” Project Report

## Description of Changes
For each test, a **SETUP** section was added to configure the mock behavior, and a **VERIFY** section was included to 
ensure that only the expected methods were executed, and that they were invoked the correct number of times.

## Learning Outcomes
This work demonstrates a clean and professional structure for simulating endpoint behavior while verifying the precise 
number of method calls within the application. It highlights the importance of test design that accurately reflects REST
semantics such as safety and idempotency.
